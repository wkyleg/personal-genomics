# Population Comparison & Ancient DNA Methodology

## Overview

This document explains our approach to ancestry analysis, which differs fundamentally from commercial DNA testing services. Instead of providing percentage estimates ("you are 45% British"), we show you the **raw data**: how your specific genotypes compare to reference populations.

## Why We Don't Give Ancestry Percentages

### The Problem with Percentages

Commercial ancestry testing services provide results like "52% British, 23% German, 15% Italian." These numbers are:

1. **Model-dependent**: Different statistical models give different results
2. **Reference-dependent**: Results change when reference panels change
3. **Historically arbitrary**: Modern political boundaries don't reflect genetic reality
4. **Falsely precise**: The confidence intervals are rarely shown

### Our Approach: Transparent Data

Instead, we show you:
- How common your genotypes are in different reference populations
- Which populations your genotypes most closely match
- The actual frequency data from scientific databases

This lets YOU interpret the data, rather than a black-box algorithm telling you what you "are."

## The 1000 Genomes Project

### What It Is

The 1000 Genomes Project (2008-2015) was an international effort to catalog human genetic variation. It sequenced the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations worldwide.

| PJL | Punjabi from Lahore, Pakistan | South Asia | 96 |

| **Americas (AMR)** |||
| MXL | Mexican Ancestry from Los Angeles | Americas | 64 |
| PUR | Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico | Americas | 104 |
| CLM | Colombians from Medellin, Colombia | Americas | 94 |
| PEL | Peruvians from Lima, Peru | Americas | 85 |

### How We Use It

For each SNP in your data that we have reference data for, we:
1. Look up your genotype
2. Find the frequency of that genotype in each reference population
3. Display this directly to you

**Example**: For rs1426654 (SLC24A5, skin pigmentation):
- If you have genotype AA, this is found in:
  - 99-100% of Europeans
  - 85% of South Asians
  - 3-7% of Africans and East Asians
  - 50-70% of admixed American populations

This tells you your allele is **common in Europeans and South Asians**, without making claims about your specific percentage.

## Ancient DNA Analysis

### What Ancient DNA Studies Tell Us

Since 2010, scientists have sequenced DNA from hundreds of ancient human remains, revolutionizing our understanding of human migration and ancestry. Key findings:

1. **Modern Europeans are a mixture** of at least three ancestral populations
2. **Pigmentation genes** have been under strong selection
3. **Neanderthal DNA** persists in all non-African populations
4. **Lactase persistence** became common only in the last 4,000 years

### Ancient Populations We Cover

#### Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG)
- **Period**: ~15,000-5,000 BCE
- **Location**: Western and Central Europe
- **Key trait**: Blue eyes, dark skin (confirmed by ancient DNA)
- **Modern contribution**: ~10-20% of European ancestry

#### Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG)
- **Period**: ~8,000-5,000 BCE
- **Location**: Eastern Europe and Russia
- **Key trait**: Mixed pigmentation
- **Modern contribution**: Part of Steppe ancestry

#### Anatolian Neolithic Farmers (ANF)
- **Period**: ~8,000-4,000 BCE
- **Origin**: Anatolia (Turkey)
- **Key trait**: Light skin (had SLC24A5 derived allele), brown eyes
- **Modern contribution**: ~30-50% of European ancestry

#### Yamnaya/Steppe Pastoralists
- **Period**: ~3,300-2,600 BCE
- **Location**: Pontic-Caspian Steppe
- **Key trait**: Light skin, tall stature
- **Modern contribution**: ~30-50% of Northern European ancestry

## Neanderthal Introgression

### What We Know

All non-African humans carry ~1-4% Neanderthal DNA, the result of interbreeding after modern humans left Africa ~50,000-70,000 years ago.

### What Neanderthal Variants Do

Some Neanderthal-derived variants have been **positively selected** in modern humans:
- **Immune genes** (TLR1, TLR6, TLR10): Enhanced pathogen response
- **OAS1**: Antiviral immunity
- **BNC2**: Skin pigmentation/freckling
- **Pain sensitivity** genes

### Detection Limitations

Consumer DNA arrays can only detect a **tiny fraction** of Neanderthal variants:
- Human genome has ~3 billion base pairs
- ~40,000 Neanderthal-derived variants exist in modern humans
- Most arrays test ~600,000-1,000,000 SNPs
- Only a handful overlap with known Neanderthal markers

**Our detection is educational, not comprehensive.**

## Limitations of Consumer DNA Testing

### What Arrays Cannot Do

1. **Distinguish neighboring populations**: Cannot tell Irish from Scottish, or Nigerian from Ghanaian
2. **Detect rare variants**: Only common variants are tested
3. **Full haplogroup determination**: Need dedicated Y-DNA or mtDNA testing
4. **Medical-grade results**: Not validated for clinical use

### What We Do Instead

Rather than pretending precision we don't have, we:
- Show you actual population frequencies
- Give confidence intervals and uncertainty
- Explain methodology and limitations
- Let you draw your own conclusions

## How to Interpret Results

### Population Comparison

When you see "Your genotype AA is found in 99% of British, 7% of Yoruba":
- This means **99% of British** in the reference panel have this genotype
- This does NOT mean you are 99% British
- It means this particular variant is common in European populations

### Ancient DNA Signals

When we detect markers "associated with Neolithic farmers":
- This means you carry alleles that were common in ancient farmers
- This does NOT give a percentage of farmer ancestry
- ALL Europeans have farmer ancestry - the question is proportions

### Most Similar Populations

When we rank populations by similarity:
- Higher similarity = your genotypes are more common in that population
- This reflects **genetic similarity**, not nationality or ethnicity
- Genetically similar ≠ culturally/historically connected
